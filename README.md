Introduction:
ICT Contact Management System (ICT-CMS) is a tool to manage contacts
information of ICT students like a basic phonebook. A user can add new contacts,
list contacts, search contact, edit contact, and delete contact as a standard feature. At
ICT, administrators have a role to manage the contact information while students
use the ICT-CMS to search for contact information and can only edit their own
information.
